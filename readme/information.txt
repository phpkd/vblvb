	          - How many links should be checked per post? If any post contains more than that defined limit, then those 'over limit' links will be ignored & will not be checked; only the first X links (as defined here) will be checked. Enter "0" for UNLIMITED.

	     o Critical Limit/Red Line
	          - Posts can be punished because of high percentage of dead links within. Define the "Critical Limit/Red Line" percentage here as a positive integer value (without any symbols). This "Critical Limit/Red Line" is the percentage that if dead links reaches or exceeded within a post, then that post will be punished.
	          - Notes & Examples:
		+ "10" means if dead links within a post reaches or exceeded 10% of all included links it will be punished. If a post has less than 10% of dead links, then it will pass as valid without punishment.
		+ "0" means that all links per post should be valid & alive (no dead links allowed, if just one link is dead the post will be punished); While "100" means the opposite, it means that all links within a post should be dead to be punished, that means if there is only one link alive & the rest are dead, the post will pass as valid without punishment.
		+ If any post has only 5 links within it to be checked, that means each link represents 20% from all checked links. It means also if only one link is dead & you've set this setting to '10%' the expression will evaluate as true & will punish that post since it has 20% of dead links.

	     o Check Succession Period
	          - Successive checks for same posts can be separated by a certain period of time, so those 'checked recently' posts didn't checked every time the script runs. Same posts can be checked multiple times, but with at least 1 day between each two successive checks. Define how many days should separate each two successive checks for the same post, or enter "0" to check posts ONLY ONCE. Note: "14" means your checked posts will be checked again every fourteen days (two weeks). "0" or a high Value usually recommended specially for large boards.

	     o Checked Posts Per Batch
	          - It's recommended to define a specific low number of posts to process in each run to prevent any possible timeout or Memory/CPU exhausting during the execution process. A Lower Value usually recommended specially for boards that has long posts with many links. There's other important factors that have strong affect as well such as: "Time/Date Cutoff Mode", "Time/Date Cutoff Value", "Check existing posts", "Maximum Checked Links Per Post", "Check Succession Period"; So please take care & try to set a logical acceptable value for each of these settings to avoid any expected/unexpected issues. You're the best one who knows your board & you're the one who can determine which suits you & your board according to your board's activity/content/requirements.
