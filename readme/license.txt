PHP KingDom Commercial Software License Agreement
http://info.phpkd.net/en/license/commercial/
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Software and any related documentation are "Commercial Items". This Software License Agreement (this "Agreement") is between you (either an individual or an entity, referred to hereinafter as "you" or "your") and PHP KingDom, and its affiliates ("PHPKD", "we", "our" or "us") for all commercial software that accompanies this Agreement, as may be updated or replaced by feature enhancements, software updates or maintenance releases (the "Software") and any services that may be provided by PHP KingDom under this Agreement ("Services"). Do not use the Software until you have carefully read the following Agreement.
By installing, copying, accessing, downloading or using the Software (or authorizing any other person to do so) you are indicating that you are 18 years of age or older (any parent or guardian of a person under the age of 18 may accept this Agreement on behalf of a user), are capable of entering into a binding legal agreement, have read and understand this Agreement and you accept its terms and conditions. If you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not install, copy, access, download or use the Software.


1. Grant of License
----------------------------
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, PHP KingDom grants to you a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide license to install, download and use a single instance of the Software on a single website server ("License") through a single installation. Each License may run one instance of the Software on one domain. Any modification of the Software intended to circumvent the foregoing is prohibited and will result in revocation of the License.
You may make a one-time, permanent transfer of your rights in the Software to a third party ("Subsequent Licensee"), provided the Software was purchased by you more than 30 days prior to the transfer, that you do not keep a copy of the Software for yourself, the Subsequent Licensee agrees to the terms of this Agreement and the License, and the Subsequent Licensee agrees to assume your rights as a licensee of the Software. You must disclose the domain where you are using (or plan to use) the License, which may be disclosed in the PHP KingDom customer area. You may set up one additional temporary test instance for the purpose of testing code, template and database modifications. Such a test instance must be password protected, and not made available to the general public at any time.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Software" includes (and the terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to) any updates, updated or replacement features enhancements, bug fixes or modified versions (collectively, "Update"). "Update" means a release of the Software which adds minor functionality enhancements to the current version. This class of release is identified by the change of the version number to the right of the decimal point, i.e. 5.1 to 5.2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, you have no License or right to use any such Update unless, at the time of acquiring such Update, you already hold a valid License to the original Software and have paid any applicable fee for the Update.

2. Restrictions
----------------------------
You may not give copies to another person, or duplicate the Software by any other means, including electronic transmission. You may make one copy of the Software in machine-readable form for backup purposes only; provided that the backup copy must include all copyright or other proprietary notices contained on the original. You may not rent, sub-license, assign, lease, loan, resell for profit, distribute, publish or network the Software or related materials or create derivative works based upon the Software or any part thereof.
You may not use the Software to engage in or allow others to engage in any illegal activity. You may not use the Software to engage in any activity that will violate the rights of third parties, including, without limitation, through the use, public display, public performance, reproduction, distribution, or modification of communications or materials that infringe copyrights, trademarks, publicity rights, privacy rights, other proprietary rights, or rights against defamation of third parties.

3. Ownership Rights
----------------------------
The Software is licensed to you by PHP KingDom for use only under the terms of the License. PHP KingDom reserves all rights not granted to you. PHP KingDom owns and retains all right, title and interest in and to the Software, including all copyrights, patents, trade secret rights, trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property rights therein. Your possession, installation, or use of the Software does not transfer to you any title to the intellectual property in the Software, and you will not acquire any rights to the Software except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. All copies of the Software made hereunder must contain the same proprietary notices that appear on and in the Software, including all Software copyright notices embedded in any design template which must remain unaltered from the original and visible at all times.

4. Termination
----------------------------
The License is effective until terminated. You may terminate the License at any time by uninstalling the Software and destroying all copies of the Software in any media. This Agreement may be terminated by PHP KingDom immediately and without notice if you fail to comply with any term or condition of the License or this Agreement. Upon such termination, you must immediately cease using the Software, and destroy all complete and partial copies of the Software.
Leased-License Holders Only. For leased-license holders of any commercial software, the License terminates on the last day of your current leased-license agreement with PHP KingDom. You may, however, purchase the Software prior to such end date, in which case the License will continue as specified in the first paragraph of this Section 4. Use of the Software after that end date without purchase makes the License void and you must immediately cease using the Software, and destroy all complete and partial copies of the Software.
PHP KingDom reserves the right to change or add to the terms of this Agreement at any time (including but not limited to Internet-based Solutions, pricing, technical support options, and other product-related policies), and to change, discontinue or impose conditions on any feature or aspect of the Software, or any Internet-based Solutions provided to you or made available to you through use of the Software. Such changes will be effective upon notification by any means reasonable to give you actual or constructive notice including by posting such terms on the PHP KingDom website, or another website designated by PHP KingDom. Your continued use of the Software will indicate your agreement to any such change.

5. Registration Data
----------------------------
You must register to use the Software and Solutions and (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information as prompted by the sign-up process (the "Registration Data"), and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it accurate, current and complete. If you provide any Registration Data that is inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or we have reasonable grounds to suspect is inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we may suspend or terminate your account unless and until such data is corrected or completed, or we may refuse any and all current or future access to and use of the Software or Services (or any portion thereof).

6. Account Access Information and Data

You are solely responsible for (a) maintaining the confidentiality and security of your access number(s), password(s), security question(s) and answer(s), account number(s), login information, and any other security or access information, used by you to access the Software and Services (collectively, "Access Information"), and (b) preventing unauthorized access to or use of the information, files or data that you store or use in or with the Software and Services (collectively, "Account Data"). We will assume that any communications we receive through use of the Access Information were sent or authorized by you.

7. Fees and Payments

PHP KINGDOM'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ACTUAL DAMAGES FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER WILL BE LIMITED TO THE PURCHASE PRICE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold PHP KingDom, and our officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates, harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, liability costs and expenses (including but not limited to attorneys' fees) arising from your use of the Software or your website users' use of the Software, laws or regulations, or any third party's rights, including but not limited to infringement of any copyright, violation of any proprietary right or invasion of any privacy rights. This obligation will survive the termination of this Agreement.

12. Controlling Law; Severability

If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, the remainder of the License will continue in full force and effect. Unless otherwise required by law, an action or proceeding by you to enforce an obligation, duty, or right arising under the License or this Agreement or by law with respect to the Software or Services must be commenced within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues.
