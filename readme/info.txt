	          - Turning this option 'ON' may cause users with low/limited internet connections to have some issues and may not be able to post, specially if their post contains many links to be checked.
		+ None
		+ All Posts
		+ Thread's First Post

	     o Check Edited Posts
	          - Should edited posts be checked live (on real time)? If yes, then which of it should be? Only thread's head (first post), or all replies as well?
	          - Turning this option 'ON' may cause users with low/limited internet connections to have some issues and may not be able to post, specially if their post contains many links to be checked.
		+ None
		+ All Posts
		+ Thread's First Post

	     o Maximum Checked Links Per Post
	          - How many links should be checked per post? If any post contains more than that defined limit, then those 'over limit' links will be ignored & will not be checked; only the first X links (as defined here) will be checked. Enter "0" for UNLIMITED.

	     o Critical Limit/Red Line
	          - Posts can be punished because of high percentage of dead links within. Define the "Critical Limit/Red Line" percentage here as a positive integer value (without any symbols). This "Critical Limit/Red Line" is the percentage that if dead links reaches or exceeded within a post, then that post will be punished.
	          - Notes & Examples:
		+ "10" means if dead links within a post reaches or exceeded 10% of all included links it will be punished. If a post has less than 10% of dead links, then it will pass as valid without punishment.
		+ "0" means that all links per post should be valid & alive (no dead links allowed, if just one link is dead the post will be punished); While "100" means the opposite, it means that all links within a post should be dead to be punished, that means if there is only one link alive & the rest are dead, the post will pass as valid without punishment.
		+ If any post has only 5 links within it to be checked, that means each link represents 20% from all checked links. It means also if only one link is dead & you've set this setting to '10%' the expression will evaluate as true & will punish that post since it has 20% of dead links.

	     o Check Succession Period
	          - Successive checks for same posts can be separated by a certain period of time, so those 'checked recently' posts didn't checked every time the script runs. Same posts can be checked multiple times, but with at least 1 day between each two successive checks. Define how many days should separate each two successive checks for the same post, or enter "0" to check posts ONLY ONCE. Note: "14" means your checked posts will be checked again every fourteen days (two weeks). "0" or a high Value usually recommended specially for large boards.

	     o Checked Posts Per Batch
	          - It's recommended to define a specific low number of posts to process in each run to prevent any possible timeout or Memory/CPU exhausting during the execution process. A Lower Value usually recommended specially for boards that has long posts with many links. There's other important factors that have strong affect as well such as: "Time/Date Cutoff Mode", "Time/Date Cutoff Value", "Check existing posts", "Maximum Checked Links Per Post", "Check Succession Period"; So please take care & try to set a logical acceptable value for each of these settings to avoid any expected/unexpected issues. You're the best one who knows your board & you're the one who can determine which suits you & your board according to your board's activity/content/requirements.

      Flag declaration:
      OK: means that there's no different between the old & the current version of this host's module. It was working fine & still working as it is.
      Fixed: means that the previous version of that host's module had some problems & wasn't working good, but the new version has been fixed & confirmed to be working fine now.
      Updated: means that the previous version of that host's module was good, but the current one has some tweaks & some optimizations.
      Permanently Dead: means that the host itself has been gone down forever, it's no more working. So the related module within the product marked also as dead & it will report all links of that host as dead.
      No longer supported: means that the bot no longer able to check this host's links & for technical limitations raised recently on those web hosts websites, so support for those hosts has been terminated & those links no longer checked.
      Semi-Dead: means that the host has problems currently, but it's not clear if it's alive or permanently dead, so we kept it alive for the mean time & will update it soon when we're sure it's permanently dead.
